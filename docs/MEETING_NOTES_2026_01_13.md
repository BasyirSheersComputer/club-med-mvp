# Meeting Notes: Club Med APAC Region Heads
**Date:** January 13, 2026
**Attendees:**
- Claudio Cavalcanti (Head of IT, APAC)
- Ashley Uchin (Room Division Product Owner, ESAP)
**Location:** Menara Axiata

## 1. Executive Summary & Strategic Shift
- **Pivot to Resort Operations:** The Commercial/Call Center segment is **out of scope** (existing AI/data lakes in place). The focus must shift entirely to **Resort Operations (Service)**.
- **Goal:** Create a centralized, streamlined solution for resort staff to manage guest interactions on the day of arrival and during the stay.
- **Status:** Internal discussions pending to draft business requirements. Next contact after Chinese New Year (CNY).

## 2. Current Landscape
- **Global Standard:** 68 resorts globally operating under a "streamlined operation" standard.
- **SOPs:** A centralized knowledge base for SOPs and guidelines exists.
- **Fragmented Objectives:** Different departments have varying short-term initiatives.
- **Previous Disconnect:** Previous pitch (Nanda Kumaran) was not fully internalized; need to ensure the new solution is strategically applicable to the correct stakeholders (Resort/Front Desk vs. IT).

## 3. Problem Statement & Requirements
- **The Gap:** Resort teams lack a unified tool to handle guest inquiries on-site.
- **Desired Solution:**
    - **Omnichannel Integration:** Single UI to manage inquiries from multiple platforms (WhatsApp, Line, Kakao Talk, WeChat).
    - **Capabilities:** AI-integrated bot for automated responses.
    - **Target User:** Resort Front Desk / Operations teams (handling fully paid guests).

## 4. Strategic Considerations
- **Pilot Locations:**
    - **Cherating:** Not ideal due to ongoing cancellations/renovations.
    - **Borneo:** Potential strategic fit (new opening, fresh start).
- **Stakeholder Engagement:** Claudio advised involving Operations & Digital Marketing immediately to check for redundancy with internal efforts.

## 5. Next Steps
1.  **Club Med Internal:**
    - Internalize the proposal.
    - Start fresh with drafting business requirements.
    - Confirm if internal teams are already working on a similar "Omnichannel Resort Tool".
2.  **Vendor (Us):**
    - **Pricing Study Scope:** Disconnect from commercial models; focus on service models (Information accuracy, streamlining, headcount modification).
    - **Wait:** Response expected just after CNY.

## 6. Action Items
- [ ] **Await Feedback:** Post-CNY sync with Claudio/Ashley.
- [ ] **Refine Value Prop:** Focus on "Service Efficiency" and "Omnichannel Unification" for Resort Staff, removing all "Call Center/Sales" language.
