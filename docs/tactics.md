# Tactics: Execution Roadmap
**Author:** CEO (Ex-$10bn Exit Founder)
**Context:** Club Med / Fosun Research
**Target:** $0 to $1B ARR
**Date:** Feb 4, 2026

## 1. Immediate Term: Operation "Borneo" (Q1 - Q2 2026)
**Goal:** Secure the Pilot Contract for Club Med Borneo (Sabah).
**Constraint:** Must be signed before "Pre-Opening" freeze (approx. June 2026).

### A. The "Magic Demo" (Product)
*   **The Feature:** "The Polyglot Inbox."
    *   *Input:* Simulate a guest messaging in Japanese on Line, a guest in Korean on Kakao, and a guest in Chinese on WeChat.
    *   *Output:* Show the Front Desk Agent seeing *all* messages in English (auto-translated) in a single feed.
    *   *The "Magic" Moment:* The Agent replies in English, and it auto-sends to the guest in their native language/channel.
*   **The "No-Integration" Pledge:**
    *   Do not ask for API access to their PMS (Oracle) yet. It slows down the deal by 6 months.
    *   Start "Over-the-Top" (standalone tab). We can integrate later once we prove value.

### B. The "Headcount" Pricing Model (Commercial)
*   **Change the Frame:** Do not quote "Software Subscription."
*   **The Quote:**
    > "Our audit shows your Front Desk handles 400 inquiries/day. That requires 4 FTEs. With ResortOS, you can handle this volume with 2 FTEs. We charge 50% of the saved labor cost."
*   **The Numbers:**
    *   Cost of G.O (incl. housing/food): $30k/year.
    *   Saving 2 G.O.s = $60k/year value.
    *   Our Price: $30k/year per resort.

### C. Stakeholder Management (Political)
*   **Claudio (IT):** Give him "Security & Compliance." Produce a one-pager on Data Privacy (GDPR/PDPA) and how the data is siloed. He is the blocker; neutralize him with safety.
*   **Ashley (Ops):** Give her "Sanity." Show her the UI where her staff isn't stressed. She is the Champion; arm her with the demo to show her boss.
*   **Stéphane Maquaire (CEO):** The "Premium" Narrative. If we get a meeting, talk about "Elevating the G.O. Role" (removing menial tasks so they can be hosts).

## 2. Short Term: The "APAC" Rollout (Q3 - Q4 2026)
**Goal:** Convert Pilot to Regional Contract (10 Resorts).
**Target:** Club Med Cherating, Bali, Phuket, Bintan.

*   **Tactic:** **"The Case Study."**
    *   Create a 2-minute video of the Borneo Front Desk usage.
    *   Metric to highlight: "Zero missed messages" and "Avg Response Time < 2 mins."
*   **Technical Debt Paydown:**
    *   Now we build the PMS Integration (Oracle/Opera). We need to know *who* is in Room 101 to automate requests ("I need towels").

## 3. Medium Term: The "Fosun" Expansion (2027)
**Goal:** Club Med Global + Other Fosun Assets (Atlantis Sanya).

*   **Tactic:** **"China Compatibility."**
    *   Ensure our WeChat/Alipay mini-program integration is flawless.
    *   We leverage the Fosun "Happiness" ecosystem. We pitch to Fosun Capital that their "Portfolio Company" (us) is increasing the valuation of their "Asset Company" (Club Med).

## 4. Long Term: The Industry Standard (2028+)
**Goal:** $100M+ ARR / IPO Path.

*   **Tactic:** **"The API Economy."**
    *   We refuse to build distinct features for Spa Booking, Golf Booking, etc.
    *   Instead, we charge SpaSoft, GolfSwitch, etc., a fee to appear in our "Guest Chat Menu."
    *   We become the "App Store" for the resort guest.

## 5. Risk Mitigation (Why startups die here)
*   **Risk:** **"Death by Customization."**
    *   Club Med will ask for a custom "Blue Button" or "Specific Report."
    *   *Response:* "We will add that to the roadmap." (Do not build custom code for one client unless they pay $1M NRE).
*   **Risk:** **"Vendor Fatigue."**
    *   Hotels hate having 50 dashboards.
    *   *Response:* We must be the *primary* screen the Front Desk keeps open. Aggressive UX dominance.
